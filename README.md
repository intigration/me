#### > establish production ready pipeline for projects, service or products delivery
=> 
=> 
=> define and set procedural contracts to comply with organization standards and quality gates.
=> apply adjustments in delivery convergence plan to identify and pre-validate newly introduced functional assumptions, risks and domain complexity.
=> identify paths for compliance and mitigation plan to seed the business success.
=> make the deliverable commercial ready with 'sell-able' tag within market.
=> differentiate the product strength and offering to compete with market players.
